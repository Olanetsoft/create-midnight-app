# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Midnight Foundation takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organization.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

### Reporting via GitHub

Instead, please use GitHub's security advisory feature:

1. Navigate to the repository's Security tab
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form with as much detail as possible

This will create a private security advisory that only the maintainers can see.

### Reporting via Email

If you prefer to report via email, please send your report to:

### Disclosure Policy

- We request that you give us reasonable time to investigate and mitigate an issue you report before making public any information about the report or sharing it with others
